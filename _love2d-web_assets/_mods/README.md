since the assets found on the webpage which i thought of using were of rather low quality

and i'm such huge fan of precision and mathematically defined shapes

i've traced some of the original pngs and this is the folder with product of my unceremonious treatment of all the ip circus we have to be bothered with at every step of the way

since the archive with officially released files and styles for LÖVE we are informed that:

`All artwork in this section is licensed under the ZLIB license, like the rest of LÖVE.`

consider the same is true for this folder, or in fact the whole repo.
