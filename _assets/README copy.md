what does it do? hmm, it would be the easiest to explain by rudely replying with a question. do you know [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)? sure you do, so this app is pretty much the same thing. 

check out these user stories to know exactly what the app does:

- as a guest user I can look through the proposals for the development of the app, read descriptions and search through the proposals as well as responses available on the website
- as a guest user I can list all tags, users, filter and sort the proposals on the website
- as a guest user I can signup using my GitHub account to be able to interact with the other co-developers and with the content of the website
- as a logged in user I can upload my own proposals as well as up-vote/down-vote those proposals submitted by others
- as a logged in user I can up-vote/down-vote the responses left by other devs
- as a logged in user and author of a proposal I can “close” the proposal once it has been signed off / discussed by others
- when a proposal or a response to a proposal is up-voted/down-voted its author gain or looses reputation points.
